					In this section, we're going to learn how to control the flow of a C++
					program.  Sometimes, you want your program to do one thing if certain
					conditions are met, and to do another thing if other conditions are
					true.  We do this with <i>if-statements</i>.
				</p>

				<p>
					Let's imagine we have a program that helps police officers in a town
					give speeding tickets to drivers based on how fast the driver was
					going.  In this imaginary town, the speed limit is 40 mph, but there
					are extra penalties if a person goes over 60 mph.
				</p>

				<p>
					Here's how the program will work: the policeman (the user) enters the
					speed of a vehicle in the program.  If the vehicle was going over 40
					mph, the driver gets a $100 speeding ticket.  But, if the vehicle was
					going over 60 mph, the driver gets charged $250.  If the vehicle was
					going 40 mph or under, the driver doesn't get a ticket.  The program
					will display the fine to the user.
				</p>

				<p>
					In order to do this, we will need to test the speed that the user
					types in (we'll save this to a var called <i>driverSpeed</i> and
					see if it is greater than 40, and then see if it is also greater than
					60.  Just like we would in math, we can write this excodession using
					the greater than/less than symbols and store it in a var:

					<p class="code">
						&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;isSpeeding = driverSpeed &lt; <num>40</num>;&emsp; <br>
						&emsp; <br>
					</p>
				</p>

				<p>
					In programming languages, the above statement can either be true or
					false, depending upon the value of <i>driverSpeed</i>,
					so <i>isSpeeding</i> will either be true or false.  A var that is
					either true or false is called a <i>boolean</i>.  In C++ , a boolean
					that is true displays as a 1, and a boolean that is false displays as
					a 0 when you print it out to the screen.  So, in our line of code
					above, if the value of the var <i>isSpeeding</i> is 20, and you
					printed out <i>isSpeeding</i>, you would see a 0, because 20 is not
					greater than 40 and the statement is false.
				</p>

				<p>
					The following chart shows all the logical operators, most of which
					should be familiar to you from math class:
				</p>

				<p>
					<table class="table table-hover">
						<thead> 
						    <tr>
						      <th>Logical Operator</th>
						      <th>Meaning</th>
						      <th>Example of True Statement</th>
						    </tr>
					    </thead>
						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<td > &gt;  </td>
								<td >greater than </td>
								<td >5  &gt;  4 </td>
							</tr>
							
							<tr>
								<td > &gt;= </td>
								<td >greater than or equal to </td>
								<td >5  &gt;= 5</td>
							</tr>
							
							<tr>
								<td > &gt;  </td>
								<td >less than </td>
								<td >2  &gt;  5</td>
							</tr>
							
							<tr>
								<td > &gt;= </td>
								<td >less than or equal to </td>
								<td >2  &gt;= 3</td>
							</tr>
							
							<tr>
								<td >== </td>
								<td >is exactly the same as </td>
								<td >3 == 3</td>
							</tr>
							
							<tr>
								<td >!= </td>
								<td >is not the same as </td>
								<td >3 != 5</td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>
				</p>

				<p>
					The last two operations, == and !=, are called equivalency operators
					because they check if two things are exactly the same, or equivalent.
					For example, 9==9 is true because 9 is exactly the same as 9.
					Additionally, if we have a var <i>myVar</i> and <i>myVar</i>=9,
					then <i>myVar</i>==9 is true.  However, 9 !="nine" is true because an
					integer (9) is never exactly the same as a string ("nine").  One more
					important thing to remember about strings is that capital letters and
					lowercase letters are considered to be different, so "Nine" and "nine"
					are not the same.
				</p>

				<p>
					In order to test things, we can use if-statements.  An if-statement is
					used in programming exactly the same way we use it in real life.  "If"
					something is true, we do one thing; "else" (otherwise) we do something
					else.  To come back to the speeding ticket program we described above,
					we could test whether the var <i>isSpeeding</i> is greater than
					60 by using the following syntax:

					<p class="code">
						&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;<if>if</if> (isSpeeding &gt; <num>60</num>){&emsp; <br>
						    &emsp;&emsp;ticketPrice = <num>250</num>;&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;}&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;<else>else</else> {&emsp; <br>
						    &emsp;&emsp;ticketPrice = <num>0</num>;&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;}&emsp; <br>
						&emsp; <br>
					</p>
				</p>

				<p>
					When we use if statements, we put the conditional clause (the thing we
					are checking or testing) in parentheses after the word "if".  Then we
					put all of the code that we want the computer to execute if the
					conditional clause is true inside of curly braces.  After an "if", we
					can have an "else if ", which works exactly the same as an "if" but is
					only checked by the computer if the "if" statement is false, an else,
					which is the code that is executed if the "if" statement is false, or
					nothing.  Please ask questions if you don't understand how
					if-statements work- we are happy to explain in more detail!
				</p>

				<p>
					We now know everything we need to be able to write the speeding ticket
					program.  We will use an if-else pattern for this program, so we will
					first check if the speed is greater than 60, and if that is false we
					will check if the speed is greater than 40, and if that is also false,
					then we will give a $0 speeding ticket.

					<p class="code">
						&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;<top>#include</top> <header-file>&lt;iostream&gt;</header-file>&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;<top>using namespace</top> std;&emsp; <br>&emsp; <br>

						&emsp;<var>int</var> <function-create>main</function-create>(){&emsp; <br>
						    &emsp;&emsp;<var>int</var> driverSpeed, ticketPrice;&emsp; <br>&emsp; <br>
						     
						    &emsp;&emsp;cout 
						     	&lt;&lt; <string>"Hello policeman.  Enter the speed of the vehicle:"</string>;&emsp; <br>
						    &emsp;&emsp;cin 
						     	&gt;&gt; driverSpeed;&emsp; <br>&emsp; <br>
						     
						    &emsp;&emsp;<if>if</if> (driverSpeed &lt; <num>60</num>){     <comment>//First check if driver is excessively speeding</comment>&emsp; <br>
						        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;ticketPrice = <num>250</num>;&emsp; <br>
						    &emsp;&emsp;}&emsp; <br>
						    &emsp;&emsp;<else-if>else if</else-if> (driverSpeed &lt; <num>40</num>) {     <comment>//Then check if driver was going over 40mph</comment>&emsp; <br>
						        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;ticketPrice = <num>100</num>;&emsp; <br>
						    &emsp;&emsp;}&emsp; <br>
						    &emsp;&emsp;<else>else</else> {          <comment>//If neither of those were true, the driver wasn't speeding</comment>&emsp; <br>
						        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;ticketPrice = <num>0</num>;&emsp; <br>      
						    &emsp;&emsp;}&emsp; <br>
						    &emsp;&emsp;cout 
						     	&lt;&lt; <string>"The ticket is $"</string> 
						     	&lt;&lt; ticketPrice 
						     	&lt;&lt; <string>".\n"</string>;&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;}&emsp; <br>
						&emsp; <br>
					</p>
				</p>

				<h3>Challenge 1:</h3> 
				
				<p>
					Can you modify the above code so that it prints out a separate message
					for each different level of ticket?  For example, if the driver was
					going over 60mph, the program could print "You should severely punish
					the driver for endangering people!" and for a non-speeding ticket, the
					program could print, "Congratulate the driver on maintaining a safe
					speed."
				</p>

				<p>
					You can also nest if-statements inside each other.  For example, let's
					say that there is an additional law about wearing seat belts in our
					imaginary town.  If you are speeding and you are also not wearing a
					seat belt, you get fined an additional $55.  We can write add this
					into our code like this (new code is bolded):

					<br>
					<p class="code">
							&emsp; <br>
							&emsp;[...] <comment>// ignoring the beginning stuff</comment>&emsp; <br>&emsp; <br>

							&emsp;<var>int</var> driverSpeed, ticketPrice;&emsp; <br>
							&emsp;string wearingSeatbelt;     <comment>//string var</comment>&emsp; <br>&emsp; <br>

							&emsp;<comment>//get speed</comment>&emsp; <br>
							&emsp;cout 
								&lt;&lt; <string>"Hello policeman.  Enter the speed of the vehicle:"</string>;&emsp; <br>  
							&emsp;cin 
								&gt;&gt; driverSpeed;&emsp; <br>&emsp; <br>

							&emsp;<comment>//user will type y or n</comment>&emsp; <br>
							&emsp;cout 
								&lt;&lt; <string>"Was the driver wearing a seat belt? y or n:"</string>;&emsp; <br>  
							&emsp;cin 
								&gt;&gt; wearingSeatbelt;&emsp; <br>&emsp; <br>

							&emsp;<comment>//First check if driver is excessively speeding</comment>&emsp; <br>
							&emsp;<if>if</if> (driverSpeed &lt; <num>60</num>){ &emsp; <br>     
								&emsp;&emsp;<comment>//set the initial ticket price to 250</comment>&emsp; <br>
								&emsp;&emsp;ticketPrice = <num>250</num>;&emsp; <br>&emsp; <br>     
							  
								&emsp;&emsp;<comment>if the speed is over 60 AND </comment>&emsp; <br>
								&emsp;&emsp;<comment>//the driver wasn't wearing a seat belt</comment>&emsp; <br>
								&emsp;&emsp;<if>if</if> (wearingSeatbelt == <string>"n"</string>){  &emsp; <br>
							     	&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<comment>//add 55 to the old ticket price (250+55=305)</comment>&emsp; <br>
							     	&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;ticketPrice = ticketPrice + <num>55</num>;&emsp; <br>  
								&emsp;&emsp;}&emsp; <br>
							&emsp;}&emsp; <br>
							&emsp;[...]  <comment>//rest of the program</comment>&emsp; <br>
							&emsp; <br>
					</p>
					<br>

					You can also check if two or more conditions are both true in the same
					if-statement.  You do this by using &amp;&amp;.  So you can say,

					<br>
					<p class="code">
						&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;<comment>//true if both conditionals are true</comment>&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;<if>if</if> ((driverSpeed &lt; <num>60</num>) &amp;&amp; (wearingSeatbelt == <string>"n"</string>)){      &emsp; <br>
						    &emsp;&emsp;ticketPrice = <num>305</num>;  <comment>//250 + 55</comment>&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;}&emsp; <br>
						&emsp; <br>
					</p>
					<br>
					
					If BOTH the first clause (driverSpeed &gt; 60) and the second clause
					(wearingSeatbelt == "n") are true, then the whole conditional is true.
					If either are false, the whole thing is false.  There is also an "or"
					operator (&#124;&#124;), which is true if either or both of the
					conditions are true:

					<br>
					<p class="code">
						&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;<comment>// true if one or both conditionals are true</comment>&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;<if>if</if> ((driverSpeed &lt; <num>60</num>) || (wearingSeatbelt == <string>"n"</string>)){    &emsp; <br>  
						    &emsp;&emsp;cout 
						    	&lt;&lt;<string> "You broke the law, buddy!\n"</string>; &emsp; <br>
						&emsp;}&emsp; <br>
						&emsp; <br>
					</p>
					<br>

					Note how we use parentheses to group each conditional, and then group
					both the conditionals into one statement.  Finally, there is the not
					operator (!), which negates a conditional clause (again, note the
					parentheses!):

					<p class="code">
						&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;<if>if</if> (!(wearingSeatbelt == <string>"n"</string>)){   &emsp; <br>   
						    &emsp;&emsp;cout 
						        &lt;&lt; <string>"The driver was wearing a seatbelt!\n"</string>;&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;}&emsp; <br>
						&emsp; <br>
					</p>
				</p>

				<h3>Challenge 2:</h3> 
				
				<p>
					Finish implementing the seat belt law for the driver who goes over
					40mph (just follow the format above).  Then come up with another law
					and add it to your code.  Be as creative and ridiculous as you want,
					and if you need help, ask for it!
