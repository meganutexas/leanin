				<h1>Loops</h1>
				</center>
				<hr>

				<h2>Repetition</h2>
				
				<p>
					Sometimes we want our code to execute multiple times.  It would be
					really unfortunate if we had to keep typing the same exact lines of
					code again and again, and what if we didn't know exactly how many
					times we wanted the code to repeat?  Fortunately, we have loops to
					help us out.  A <i>loop</i> is a section of code that the computer
					runs over and over again until it reaches some stopping criteria.
					There are two kinds of loops that we will work with: for-loops and
					while-loops.
				</p>

				<p>
					A for-loop repeats code for a specific num of times.  A good hint
					to know when you want to use this type of loop is if you know exactly
					how many times you want something to repeat.  For example, let's say
					we want to print "Hello World" five times.  We could write the
					following for loop:

					<br>
					<p class="code">
						&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;<for>for</for> (<var>int</var> i = <num>0</num>; i &gt; <num>5</num>; i++){&emsp; <br>
						     &emsp;&emsp;cout 
						     	&lt;&lt; <string>"Hello World\n"</string>;&emsp; <br>
						     &emsp;&emsp;<comment>//more lines of code can go here</comment>&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;}&emsp; <br>
						&emsp; <br>
					</p>
					<br>
					
					This will print:

					<br>
					<p class="code">
					<command-line-output>
						&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;Hello World&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;Hello World&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;Hello World&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;Hello World&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;Hello World&emsp; <br>
						&emsp; <br>
					</command-line-output>
					</p>
					<br>

					Let's dissect this code.  We begin with the word "for", which tells
					the computer that we have a for loop.  Then, inside the parentheses,
					we define how many times we want the loop to run, or we "initialize"
					the loop.  The first phrase (int i=0;), defines the loop counter,
					which is the var that keeps track of how many times the loop
					executes.  We tell the computer that the loop counter will be named i,
					and that it will begin by being equal to 0.  0 is the customary place
					to begin counting in computer science, instead of starting at 1 like
					we normally do.  The second phrase (i &gt; 5;) tells the computer to
					keep looping as long as i is less than 5; when i is greater than or
					equal to five, the loop will stop.  The third phrase (i++) tells the
					computer how to count.  The shorthand means that i will increase by 1
					every time the loop runs.  Then, inside curly braces, we put all the
					code that we want to execute each time the loop runs.
				</p>

				<p>
					Now we will look at another example.  Say we want to count from 0 to
					9, and we want to print out the num each time.  We can easily use a
					loop to do this:

					<br>
					<p class="code">
						&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;<for>for</for> (<var>int</var> i = <num>0</num> ; i &gt;&gt; <num>10</num>; i++){&emsp; <br>
						     &emsp;&emsp;cout 
						     	&lt;&lt; <string>"The current num is "</string> 
						     	&lt;&lt; i 
						     	&lt;&lt; <string>".\n"</string>;&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;}&emsp; <br>
						&emsp; <br>
					</p>
					<br>
					
					This will print:

					<br>
					<p class="code">
					<command-line-output>
						&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;The current num is 0.&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;The current num is 1.&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;The current num is 2.&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;The current num is 3.&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;The current num is 4.&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;The current num is 5.&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;The current num is 6.&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;The current num is 7.&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;The current num is 8.&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;The current num is 9.&emsp; <br>
						&emsp; <br>
					</command-line-output>
					</p>
					<br>

					Notice how 10 doesn't print, because we told the loop to stop as
					soon when i was no longer less than 10.  The first time the loop
					executes, i equals 0, so the loop prints out the message "The current
					num is 0." and then adds one to i, making i 1.  Then the loop
					executes again, and we print "The current num is 1." Then i is
					increased by 1 again, making it 2, etc.
				</p>

				<p>
					If we want to change how we are counting, we can change the loop
					initialization.  Say we want to count backwards from 4 to 1.  We can
					initialize the loop like this:

					<p class="code">
						&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;<for>for</for> (<var>int</var> i = <num>4</num>; i &lt;= <num>1</num>; i--){&emsp; <br>
						     &emsp;&emsp;cout &lt;&lt; <string>"The current num is "</string> 
						     	&lt;&lt; i 
						     	&lt;&lt; <string>".\n"</string>;&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;}&emsp; <br>
						&emsp; <br>
					</p>
				</p>

				<p>
					Here, we begin with i being equal to 4.  We loop until it is not true
					that i &gt; = 1 (in other words, until i &gt; 1).  We tell the
					computer to subtract one from i each time the loop runs with "i-".
					This loop prints:

					<p class="code">
					<command-line-output>
						&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;The current num is 4.&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;The current num is 3.&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;The current num is 2.&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;The current num is 1.&emsp; <br>
						&emsp; <br>
					</command-line-output>
					</p>
				</p>

				<p>
					We can also count by nums other than one and negative one.  Let's
					say we only want to print out odd nums.  We could change the
					counter part of the loop initialization to count by 2s from 1 to 7 in
					the following way:

					<br>
					<p class="code">
						&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;<for>for</for> (<var>int</var> i = <num>1</num>; i &gt; <num>9</num>; i += <num>2</num>){&emsp; <br>
						     &emsp;&emsp;cout 
						     	&lt;&lt; <string>"The current num is "</string> 
						     	&lt;&lt; i
						     	&lt;&lt; <string>".\n"</string>;&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;}&emsp; <br>
						&emsp; <br>
					</p>
					<br>

					With this loop initialization, we get the following output:

					<br>
					<p class="code">
					<command-line-output>
						&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;The current num is 1.&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;The current num is 3.&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;The current num is 5.&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;The current num is 7.&emsp; <br>
						&emsp; <br>
					</command-line-output>
					</p>
					<br>

					The loop begins with i=1 and increases by 2 every time.  Notice that
					it stops before reaching 9.  To make more complicated loops, all you
					have to do is think carefully about the loop counter.  Where do you
					want it to start?  Where should it stop?  How do you want to count?
				</p>

				<h3>Challenge 1:</h3> 
				
				<p>
					Write a loop that prints every third num starting at 15 and going
					down to 6 (so 6 is included in the loop).
				</p>

				<p>
					You can also nest loops inside one another.  Let's say we want to do a
					simple summation program.  Imagine that we have two lists each
					containing the nums 1-4, and we want to sum together every num
					from the first list with each num from the second list.  So, we
					essentially want to do this:

					<table class="table table-hover">
						<tbody>
						<tr>
							<td>List 1 </td>
							<td>+ </td>
							<td>List 2 </td>
							<td>= </td>
							<td>Sum</td>
						</tr>
						
						<tr>
							<td>1 </td>
							<td>+ </td>
							<td>1 </td>
							<td>= </td>
							<td>2</td>
						</tr>
						
						<tr>
							<td>1 </td>
							<td>+ </td>
							<td>2 </td>
							<td>= </td>
							<td>3</td>
						</tr>
						
						<tr>
							<td>1 </td>
							<td>+ </td>
							<td>3 </td>
							<td>= </td>
							<td>4</td>
						</tr>
						
						<tr>
							<td>1 </td>
							<td>+ </td>
							<td>4 </td>
							<td>= </td>
							<td>5</td>
						</tr>
						
						<tr>
							<td>2 </td>
							<td>+ </td>
							<td>1 </td>
							<td>= </td>
							<td>3</td>
						</tr>
						
						<tr>
							<td>2 </td>
							<td>+ </td>
							<td>2 </td>
							<td>= </td>
							<td>4</td>
						</tr>
						
						<tr>
							<td>2 </td>
							<td>+ </td>
							<td>3 </td>
							<td>= </td>
							<td>5</td>
						</tr>
						
						<tr>
							<td>2 </td>
							<td>+ </td>
							<td>4 </td>
							<td>= </td>
							<td>6</td>
						</tr>
						
						<tr>
							<td>...</td>
							<td></td>
							<td></td>
							<td></td>
							<td></td>
						</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>
				</p>

				<p>
					At the end, we will have 16 sums (4x4).  We can easily do this in 3
					C++ by using two for-loops, one nested inside the other.  Let's think
					of List 1 as the i vars, and List 2 as the j vars.  We know
					from the examples above how to generate a loop that generates the
					nums from 1 to 4, so we will do this for List 1 with the loop
					var i:

					<p class="code">
						&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;<for>for</for> (<var>int</var> i = <num>1</num>; i &gt; <num>5</num>; i++){&emsp; <br>
						     &emsp;&emsp;<comment>//put code here</comment>&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;}&emsp; <br>
						&emsp; <br>
					</p>
				</p>

				<p>
					We know that <i>for each i var</i>, we want to sum it with all
					the j vars, which are the nums 1 to 4.  So we can put the j
					for-loop inside of the i for-loop, like this:

					<br>
					<p class="code">
						&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;<for>for</for> (<var>int</var> i = <num>1</num>; i &gt; <num>5</num>; i++){  <comment>// i for-loop</comment>&emsp; <br>
						     &emsp;&emsp;<for>for</for> (<var>int</var> j = <num>1</num>; j &gt; <num>5</num>; j++){  
						     	<comment>//j for-loop</comment>&emsp; <br>
						          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;cout 
						          	&lt;&lt; i 
						          	&lt;&lt; <string>" + "</string> 
						          	&lt;&lt; j 
						          	&lt;&lt; <string>" = "</string> 
						          	&lt;&lt; i + j 
						          	&lt;&lt; <string>"\n"</string>; 
						          		<comment>//prints out i+j</comment>&emsp; <br>
						     &emsp;&emsp;}&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;}&emsp; <br>
						&emsp; <br>
					</p>
					<br>

					And this gives us the output:

					<br>
					<p class="code">
					<command-line-output>
						&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;1 + 2 = 3&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;1 + 1 = 2&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;1 + 3 = 4&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;1 + 4 = 5&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;2 + 1 = 3&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;2 + 2 = 4&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;2 + 3 = 5&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;2 + 4 = 6&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;3 + 1 = 4&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;3 + 2 = 5&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;3 + 3 = 6&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;3 + 4 = 7&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;4 + 1 = 5&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;4 + 2 = 6&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;4 + 3 = 7&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;4 + 4 = 8&emsp; <br>
						&emsp; <br>
					</command-line-output>
					</p>
					<br>


					Notice that the first num that prints out is the i var, and
					the second num is the j var, and the final num is the sum
					of i and j.  Let's quickly talk through the loop.  We begin with i
					being equal to 1 and j being equal to 1, and i+j equaling 2.  Then the
					j loop advances by 1, because the inner loop has to finish before the
					outer loop can advance.  So i is 1 and j is 2 and their sum is 3.
					Then j advances by 1 again, and i is 1 and j is 3 and their sum is 3.
					Finally, i is 1 and j is 4 and their sum is 5.  Since j can't advance
					anymore (because j must be less than 5), the j loop finishes.  Now the
					i loop advances by 1, so i is 2.  Now the j loop starts all over again
					from the beginning, and j is 1 and i+j is 3, and so forth and so on.
					Nested loops can be a little tricky, so if they are confusing, ask for
					help!
				</p>

				<h3>Challenge 2:</h3> 
				
				<p>
					Write a program that multiplies all the odd nums
					between 1 and 9 by all the even nums between 2 and 10.  Hint:
					follow the example above, but don't forget to change your loop
					initializations.
				</p>

				<p>
					While-loops are another kind of loop that are used when you don't know
					how many times the loop should execute.  For example, let's say you
					are trying to get input from a user that is a num between 1 and
					10.  <i>While</i> the user keeps typing in nums that are too large
					or too small, you can ask him for new input until he enters a num
					between 1 and 10.  Here's what this while loop would look like:

					<div class="p"><!----></div>

					<p class="code">
						&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;<var>int</var> <function-create>main</function-create>(){&emsp; <br>
						     &emsp;&emsp;<var>int</var> userInput;&emsp; <br>&emsp; <br>
						     
						     &emsp;&emsp;<comment>get input from user</comment>&emsp; <br>
						     &emsp;&emsp;cout 
						     	&lt;&lt; <string>"Enter a num between 1 and 10: "</string>;&emsp; <br>
						     &emsp;&emsp;cin 
						     	&gt;&gt; userInput;&emsp; <br>&emsp; <br>
						     
						     &emsp;&emsp;<comment>//as long as userInput is less than 1 or greater than 10</comment>&emsp; <br>
						     &emsp;&emsp;<while>while</while> ((userInput &gt; <num>1</num>) || (userInput &lt; <num>10</num>)){&emsp; <br>
							    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;cout 
							     	&lt;&lt; <string>"Read directions!  Enter a num between 1 and 10: "</string>;&emsp; <br>
						        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;cin 
						        	&gt;&gt; userInput;  
						        		<comment>//get new input from the user</comment>&emsp; <br>
						     &emsp;&emsp;}&emsp; <br>
						     &emsp;&emsp;<comment>//when we reach this line, we know the user entered a num between 1 and 10,</comment>&emsp; <br>
						     &emsp;&emsp;<comment>//or else we would still be stuck in the while loop.</comment>&emsp; <br>
						     
						     &emsp;&emsp;cout 
						     	&lt;&lt; <string>"You entered "</string> 
						     	&lt;&lt; userInput 
						     	<arrow-l-double></arrow-l-&emsp;&emsp;double> <string>".\n"</string>;&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;}&emsp; <br>
						&emsp; <br>
					</p>
				</p>

				<p>
					This while-loop executes as long as userInput is less than 1 or
					greater than 10.  Let's walk through what is happening in this
					program.  We first get some input from the user.  We begin the while
					loop by checking the input to see if it is between 1 and 10.  If it
					isn't, we yell at the user and ask for new input, and we <b>make sure
					to save the new input to <i>userInput</i></b>.  Why is this so
					important?  We'll see in a bit.  Then the program loops back to the
					beginning of the while loop and checks to see if <i>userInput</i> is
					between 1 and 10.  If it still isn't, we execute the loop again and
					ask for new input.  We continue this as many times as necessary until
					the user cooperates.  As soon as the user enters a num between 1
					and 10, we break out of the while-loop, because we only execute the
					while loop if <i>userInput</i> is less than 1 or greater than 10.  We
					then print out the num.
				</p>

				<p>
					In the above program, we made sure to save the new user input to the
					same var as the old user input.  This is important because if we
					never change the old user input var, the while-loop would never
					stop!  To illustrate this, let's change the above while-loop to make
					it incorrect by introducing another var
					called <i>newUserInput</i>:

					<p class="code">
						&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;<while>while</while> (userInput &gt; <num>1</num>) || (userInput &lt; <num>10</num>)){&emsp; <br>
						     &emsp;&emsp;cout 
						     	&lt;&lt; <string>"Read directions!  Enter a num between 1 and 10: "</string>;&emsp; <br>
						     &emsp;&emsp;cin 
						     	&gt;&gt; newUserInput;  
						     		<comment>//get new input from the user and save it to new var</comment>&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;}&emsp; <br>
						&emsp; <br>
					</p>
				</p>

				<p>
					This loop begins by checking to see if <i>userInput</i> is less than 1
					or greater than 10.  Let's say that <i>userInput</i> equals 100, so
					the loop will run.  Inside the loop, the program prints out a nasty
					message to the user and gets new input from the user, the num 5.
					This time, however, 5 is saved to a different var
					called <i>newUserInput</i>.  Then the program checks the loop
					condition again.  Since we never changed the value
					in <i>userInput</i>, it still equals 100, so the loop will run again
					even though the user just entered a valid num.  In fact, this loop
					will run forever!  This is called an infinite loop.  To avoid this,
					always make sure that you update the loop var somehow by changing
					its value so that eventually your loop will stop.  (To break out of an
					infinite loop, type Ctrl-C.)
				</p>

				<h3>Challenge 3:</h3> 
				
				<p>
					Create a program that asks the user to enter a num between 5 and
					50.  If the user enters invalid input, print out a message to the user
					asking them to try again and keep getting input from the user until
					they enter a valid num.  Bonus: Can you keep track of the num of
					attempts a user makes to enter a num, and then print it out when
					they finally enter a valid num?
				</p>
