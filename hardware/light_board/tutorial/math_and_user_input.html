				<h2>Here we go!</h2>
				
				<p>
					Now let's move on to some simple math programs.  Let's start by
					writing a program that converts a person's weight on earth to his or
					her weight on the moon.  An object that weighs one pound on Earth
					would weigh 0.1654 pounds on the moon, according to Wikipedia.
					Therefore, if we know the weight of something on Earth, we can
					multiply that weight by 0.1654 to get its weight on the moon.  In C++,
					we recodesent multiplication with the * symbol.
				</p>

				<p>
					In order to write this program, we will need to ask the user of our
					program for his or her weight, store that information in the computer,
					do the conversion, and then display the moon weight back to the user.
					The easiest way to do this is to save all the nums in the program
					as vars.  Just like in math class, a var is a letter or a
					word that stands for a num or a mathematical formula.  For example,
					we can say
					<p class="code">
						&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;x = <num>4</num>;&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;y = <num>5</num> * x;
						&emsp; <br>&emsp; <br>
					</p>
					<br>
					and whenever we use the var x in our program, the computer will
					know that the x means 4.  Likewise, the computer knows that y means
					20.  When you write vars, try to use better names than x and y.
					A good var name describes the value that it stands for.  So, if
					we have a var that stands for a person's weight on earth, we
					should call that var <i>earthWeight</i>.  Keep in mind that
					vars can't have spaces and should not start with nums.
				</p>

				<p>
					In C++ , we are required to define the <i>type</i> of our vars.
					For example, if we know that a var will store a decimal point
					num, we declare it to be a <i>float</i>, which stands for floating
					(decimal) point num.  We always declare our vars inside a
					function before writing any other code (so for the main function, it
					would be the first line under <i>int main(){</i>).  We do this by
					saying the var type and then the names of all the vars that
					are that type, followed by a semi-colon.  For example, we would
					say <i>float earthWeight</i> for the var <i>earthWeight</i>
					described above.  For our program, all our vars will be floats,
					since they are all decimal point nums.  Here's a quick reference of
					types in C++:
				</p>

				<p>
					<center>
						<table class="table table-hover">
							<thead>
								<tr>
									<th><b>Type</b></th>
									<th><b>Example</b></th>
								</tr>
							</thead>
							
							<tbody>
								<tr>
									<td>float </td>
									<td>0.124 or 4.0</td>
								</tr>
								
								<tr>
									<td>int </td>
									<td>4 or 134</td>
								</tr>
								
								<tr>
									<td>string </td>
									<td>"Hello World"</td>
								</tr>
								
								<tr>
									<td>bool </td>
									<td>true/false</td>
								</tr>
							</tbody>
						</table>
					</center>
				</p>

				<p>
					Let's write out an algorithm for this program, so that we make sure
					the computer has all the information it needs to do the program.
				</p>

				<p>
					<ol type="1">
						<li> Save the conversion factor (0.1654) as the var <i>conversionFactor</i></li>
						<li> Ask the user's weight</li>
						<li> Save the weight to a var called <i>earthWeight</i></li>
						<li> Multiply <i>earthWeight</i> and <i>conversionFactor</i> and save the result as the var <i>moonWeight</i></li>
						<li> Display <i>moonWeight</i> to the user</li>
					</ol>

					The only tricky part of this program will be getting input from the
					user.  In order to do that, we will need to use a special command
					called <i>cin</i>.  This command takes whatever the user types and
					saves it to a var.  The <i>syntax</i> (the structure) of the
					command looks like this:
					<br>
					<p class="code">
						&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;cin &gt;&gt; myvar;
						&emsp; <br>&emsp; <br>
					</p>
					<br>

					When the computer reaches this point in the program, it will display a
					prompt for the user to type.  The user can then type and hit the
					"Enter" key, and the computer saves whatever the user typed to the
					var called <i>myvar</i>.  In our program, we will
					replace <i>myvar</i> with <i>earthWeight</i>.
				</p>

				<p>
					The last thing we have to address is how to print out the person's
					weight on the moon after we do the conversion.  We can use <i>cout</i>
					again and simply surround the var with double-left angle
					brackets, like this:

					<p class="code">
						&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;cout 
							&lt;&lt; <string>"You would weigh "</string>
							&lt;&lt; moonWeight 
							&lt;&lt; <string>" lbs on the moon.\n"</string>;
						&emsp; <br>&emsp; <br>
					</p>
					<br>
					
					This puts together the two strings and the var <i>moonWeight</i>
					and sends the whole thing to cout to be displayed.
				</p>

				<p>
					Now we're ready to write the program.  The text codeceded by "//" is a
					comment---just notes to anyone reading the code.  Comments are ignored
					by the computer and are just used by programmers to explain parts of
					their code.  It's good practice to have short comments in your code.

					<p class="code">
						&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;<top>#include</top> <header-file>&lt;iostream&gt;</header-file>&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;<top>using namespace</top> std;&emsp; <br>&emsp; <br>

						&emsp;<var>int</var> <function-create>main</function-create>(){&emsp; <br>
						     &emsp;&emsp;<var>float</var> conversionFactor, earthWeight, moonWeight;  
						     	<comment>//define vars as floats</comment>&emsp; <br>

						     &emsp;&emsp;cout 
						     	&lt;&lt; <string>"Enter your weight on earth:"</string>;  
						     		<comment>//prompt the user to enter weight</comment>&emsp; <br>
						     &emsp;&emsp;cin 
						     	&gt;&gt; earthWeight; 
						     		<comment>//store what the user types as earthWeight</comment>&emsp; <br>
						     
						     &emsp;&emsp;conversionFactor = <num>0.1654</num>;&emsp; <br>
						     &emsp;&emsp;moonWeight = earthWeight*conversionFactor;&emsp; <br>
						     &emsp;&emsp;cout 
						     	&lt;&lt; <string>"You would weigh "</string> 
						     	&lt;&lt; moonWeight &lt;&lt; <string>" lbs on the moon.\n"</string>;  
						     		<comment>//print out conversion</comment>&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;}
						&emsp; <br>&emsp; <br>
					</p>
				</p>

				<p>
					There are lots of math operators available in C++.  The most common
					are the following:
					<center>
						<table class="table table-hover"> 
							<thead>
								<tr>
									<th><b>Operator</b></th>
									<th><b>Operation</b></th>
								</tr>
							</thead>
							
							<tbody>
								<tr>
									<td>+ </td>
									<td>addition</td>
								</tr>
								
								<tr>
									<td>&#8722; </td>
									<td>subtraction</td>
								</tr>
								
								<tr>
									<td >* </td>
									<td>multiplication</td>
								</tr>
								
								<tr>
									<td>/ </td>
									<td>division</td>
								</tr>
								
								<tr>
									<td>% </td>
									<td>modulus (remainder)</td>
								</tr>
							</tbody>
						</table>
					</center>
				</p>

				<p>
					The % operator gives you the remainder of integer division.  So if you
					want the remainder of 5/2 (which is 1), you would say:
					
					<p class="code">
						&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;rem = <num>5</num> % <num>2</num>;
						&emsp; <br>&emsp; <br>
					</p>
					<br>
					
					This is very useful in programming, since you can easily decide is a
					num is even, odd, or a multiple of some other num.
				</p>

				<h3>Challenge 1:</h3> 

				<p>
					Write a program that reverses the program above.  This program will
					take the user's weight on the moon and convert it to Earth weight.
					Hint: What's the mathematical opposite of multiplication?
				</p>

				<h3>Challenge 2:</h3> 
				
				<p>
					Write a program that asks the user for two nums, and then prints
					out the sum of the two nums.  Hint: Use multiple <i>cin</i>
					commands.
				</p>

					Next, you'll learn about <a href="functions.html">functions</a>.
