				<h1 align="center">Functions</h1>
				<hr>
				
				<p>
					Functions are a way to organize chunks of your code together.  A
					function is a group of statements about a related subtask that is
					bundled together by a name.  For example, we might have
					a <i>getLetter</i> function that asks the user for a lowercase letter,
					or an <i>averagenums</i> function that averages a list of nums.
					Functions are important because they allow your code to be
					modular---you write a function once, and you can use that function
					over and over.
				</p>

				<p>
					We have already seen some functions.  main() is the most important
					function in a program, because it contains all the code necessary to
					start the program and is responsible for calling other functions.
					Let's take a second to review the setup of main:

					<p class="code">
						&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;<var>int</var> <function-create>main</function-create>(){&emsp; <br>
						     &emsp;&emsp;<comment>//code goes here</comment>&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;}&emsp; <br>
						&emsp; <br>
					</p>
				</p>

				<p>
					We begin by declaring the <i>return type</i> of main to be an integer.
					This tells the computer that we intend for main to send back an
					integer when it is finished.  Usually, this is accomplished through
					a <i>return</i> statement, and, by convention, main returns a 1 if
					there was an error and 0 if the program completes successfully.  We
					haven't been including a return statement and, for main (and, really,
					only main!), it isn't absolutely necessary. We'll talk more about
					return types for other functions soon.
				</p>

				<p>
					We then write the name of the function, main, and follow it with a set
					of parentheses.  These parentheses are for parameters. Parameters
					things like nums or vars that you send to a function so that
					it can use them in its code.  For our purposes, they are empty for
					main, but we'll see them in action in other functions soon.
				</p>

				<p>
					Finally we have a set of curly braces, and we put the code that
					belongs to main inside the curly braces.
				</p>

				<p>
					Let's try writing a very simple function that prints the greeting
					"Hello World!".  We will call (run) this function from main.  It won't
					take any parameters or return anything, so the return type of this
					function will be <i>void</i>.  Here's how we would set it up:

					<div class="p"><!----></div>

					<p class="code">
						&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;<top>#include</top> <header-file>&lt;iostream&gt;</header-file>;&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;<top>using namespace</top> std;&emsp; <br>&emsp; <br>

						&emsp;<var>void</var> <function-create>printGreeting</function-create>(){&emsp; <br>
						    &emsp;&emsp;cout 
						    	&lt;&lt; <string>"Hello World!\n"</string>;&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;}&emsp; <br>&emsp; <br>

						&emsp;<var>int</var> <function-create>main</function-create>(){&emsp; <br>
						    &emsp;&emsp;<function-use>printGreeting()</function-use>;&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;}&emsp; <br>
						&emsp; <br>
					</p>
				</p>

				<p>
					Here, we made the <i>printGreeting</i> function exactly like we made
					main.  We declared its return type to be void, named it
					printGreeting, and put no parameters inside the parentheses.  Inside
					the curly braces, we wrote the same code we used for our very first
					C++ program.
				</p>

				<p>
					What's interesting is how we call, or run, the function.  Inside of
					main, we call the function by naming it and then putting the
					arguments, or values to be assigned to the parameters, we want to send
					it inside of parentheses.  We don't want to send it any arguments
					since it doesn't accept any parameters (more on this in a bit), so we
					leave the parentheses blank.  As always, we end the line with a
					semi-colon.
				</p>

				<p>
					The way that this program works is the following: the computer begins
					running the program inside the main function.  When it gets to
					the <i>printGreeting</i> function, it "jumps" up to where we defined
					the <i>printGreeting</i> function and starts executing that code.
					When it gets to the end of the printGreeting function, it jumps back
					down to the main function exactly where it left off and continues
					executing the rest of the code in main.
				</p>

				<p>
					Let's look at a slightly more complicated function that uses
					parameters.  In this example, we're going to change
					the <i>printGreeting</i> function so that it prints out
					"Hello <i>name</i>", where <i>name</i> is some name that the user
					enters.  <i>printGreeting</i> will be sent the name to print out from
					main.  So, the general layout of this program will be: start in main,
					get a name from the user, send that name to <i>printGreeting</i>,
					print out the hello message, go back to main.  It sounds complicated,
					but it's really codetty easy.
				</p>

				<p>
					When a function takes a parameter, we need to tell the computer what
					kind of parameter to expect.  So, since we want to
					give <i>printGreeting</i> a name, the parameter will be a string.  We
					also want to give the computer the name of the parameter to expect,
					which we can use inside the <i>printGreeting</i> function (but only
					inside this function).  So we will call it <i>name</i>.  So,
					the <i>printGreeting</i> function will look like this, with the name
					var used in the <i>cout</i> function:

					<p class="code">
						&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;<var>void</var> <function-create>printGreeting</function-create>(string name){&emsp; <br>
						    &emsp;&emsp;cout 
						    	&lt;&lt; <string>"Hello " 
						    	&lt;&lt; name 
						    	&lt;&lt; "!\n"</string>;&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;}&emsp; <br>
						&emsp; <br>
					</p>
				</p>

				<p>
					Now the computer knows that anything that calls
					the <i>printGreeting</i> function will need to provide a string
					argument that will be called <i>name</i> inside the function.  So, in
					order to call the function, we need to get some input from the user
					and provide that input when we call the <i>printGreeting</i> function
					from main:

					<p class="code">
						&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;<var>int</var> <function-create>main</function-create>(){&emsp; <br>
						    &emsp;&emsp;string userName;&emsp; <br>
						    &emsp;&emsp;cout 
						    	&lt;&lt; <string>"Enter a name: "</string>;&emsp; <br>
						    &emsp;&emsp;cin 
						    	<arrow-r><arrow-r>userName;&emsp; <br>
						    &emsp;&emsp;<fucntion-use>printGreeting</fucntion-use>(userName);&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;}&emsp; <br>
						&emsp; <br>
					</p>
					<br>
					
					Here, we got a string <i>userName</i> from the user and sent it to
					the <i>printGreeting</i> function by placing it inside the
					parentheses.
				</p>

				<p>
					Before we go any further, we need to have a discussion about the
					difference between arguments and parameters.  Arguments are what
					you <i>send</i> to a function, and parameters are what a function
					expects to <i>receive</i>.  When the <i>printGreeting</i> function is
					called from main, the argument <i>userName's</i> value is copied to
					the parameter <i>name</i> in <i>printGreeting</i>.  While the computer
					is executing the code in <i>printGreeting</i>, it can't use the
					var <i>userName</i>, because that var is only defined
					(available) in main.  So that's why we have a parameter <i>name</i>-
					the value of <i>userName</i> gets copied to <i>name</i> so that the
					program has access to that data.  When the computer finished
					executing <i>printGreeting</i> and returns to main, it can again use
					the var <i>userName</i>, but it can no longer use <i>name</i>.
					This is what is known as the <i>scope</i> of a var, which means
					where the var is defined and can be used.
				</p>

				<p>
					The reason that functions are so great is that we can reuse them and
					give them different parameters.  For example, without changing
					the <i>printGreeting</i> function at all, we can use it to print
					greetings to three different people:

					<br>
					<p class="code">
						&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;<top>#include</top> <header-file>&lt;iostream&gt;</header-file>;&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;<top>using namespace</top> std;&emsp; <br>&emsp; <br>

						&emsp;<var>void</var> <function-create>printGreeting</function-create>(string name){&emsp; <br>
						    &emsp;&emsp;cout 
						    	&lt;&lt; <string>"Hello " 
						    	&lt;&lt; name 
						    	&lt;&lt; "!\n"</string>;&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;}&emsp; <br>&emsp; <br>

						&emsp;<var>int</var> <function-create>main(</function-create>{&emsp; <br>
						    &emsp;&emsp;printGreeting(<string>"Alison"</string>);&emsp; <br>
						    &emsp;&emsp;printGreeting(<string>"Brian"</string>);&emsp; <br>
						    &emsp;&emsp;printGreeting(<string>"Clifford the Big Red Dog"</string>);&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;}&emsp; <br>
						&emsp; <br>
					</p>
					<br>

					And we would get the following output:

					<br>
					<p class="code">
					<command-line-output>
						&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;Hello Alison!&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;Hello Brian!&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;Hello Clifford the Big Red Dog!&emsp; <br>
						&emsp; <br>&emsp; <br>
					</command-line-output>
					</p>
				</p>

				<p>
					That's codetty convenient.  We can also use functions to do computation
					for us and return the answers back to main.  For example, let's
					imagine that we want to write a function called <i>squareANum</i> that
					calculates the square of a num.  We know from math class that the
					square of a num is that num multiplied by itself.  So, let's
					write a function that takes a floating point num and squares it.
					After we figure out the square of the num (which we'll
					call <i>numSquared</i>), we'll need a way to return our answer back to
					the function that called it.  To do this, we simply say:

					<p class="code">
						&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;<return>return</return> numSquared;
						&emsp; <br>&emsp; <br>
					</p>
					<br>

					This is called the return statement, and it is always the <b>last</b>
					line in a function.  Since we know that we are squaring floats, we
					will be returning a float, so the return type of this function will be
					a float as well.  Now we're ready to write our function:

					<p class="code">
						&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;<var>float</var> squareANum(<var>float</var> num){&emsp; <br>
						    &emsp;&emsp;<var>float</var> numSquared;&emsp; <br>&emsp; <br>

						    &emsp;&emsp;numSquared = num * num;&emsp; <br>
						    &emsp;&emsp;<return>return</return> numSquared;&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;}&emsp; <br>
						&emsp; <br>
					</p>
					<br>

					We write the function as we normally would, and then tell the computer
					to return <i>numSquared</i> to the function that called it.  Since we
					are returning something to main, we need to set up a var to store
					the value that we are returning.  This part of programming is like
					playing a game of catch.  You can imagine that <i>squareANum</i> and
					main are playing a game of catch, and <i>squareANum</i> is throwing a
					ball named <i>numSquared</i> at main.  If main doesn't catch the ball
					by having a var ready to catch it, the ball will fall in the
					grass and be lost.  In programming, if a function doesn't have a
					var in place to receive a returned value, that value is gone
					forever.  To codevent this from happening, we'll set our function call
					to <i>squareANum</i> equal to the var <i>theNumSquared</i>.
					Here's the whole program:

					<br>
					<p class="code">
						&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;<top>#include</top> <header-file>&lt;iostream&gt;</header-file>&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;<top>using namespace</top> std;&emsp; <br>&emsp; <br>

						&emsp;<var>float</var> squareANum(<var>float</var> num){&emsp; <br>
						    &emsp;&emsp;<var>float</var> numSquared;&emsp; <br>&emsp; <br>

						    &emsp;&emsp;numSquared = num * num;&emsp; <br>
						    &emsp;&emsp;<return>return</return> numSquared;&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;}&emsp; <br>&emsp; <br>

						&emsp;<var>int</var> <function-create>main</function-create>(){&emsp; <br>
						    &emsp;&emsp;<var>float</var> numToSquare, theSquarednum;&emsp; <br>&emsp; <br>
						          
						    &emsp;&emsp;numToSquare = <num>5.5</num>;&emsp; <br>
						    &emsp;&emsp;theSquarednum = squareANum(numToSquare);  <comment>//catch the returned value</comment>&emsp; <br>
						    &emsp;&emsp;cout 
						    	&gt;<arrow-l> </arrow-l>numToSquare 
						    	&lt;&lt; <string>" squared equals " </string>
						    	&lt;&lt; theSquarednum 
						    	&lt;&lt;<string> ".\n"</string>;&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;}&emsp; <br>
						&emsp; <br>
					</p>
					<br>

					Note that you must either a) write a function's code earlier in the
					program text than it is called or b) include a prototype of that
					function at the top of the file.  A <i>function prototype</i> is just
					the return type, name, and parameter definition followed by a
					semicolon.  Function prototypes usually appear before the first
					function and after the <tt>include</tt> files.
				</p>

				<h3>Challenge 1:</h3>
				
				<p>
					Write a program similar to the one that triples a num and adds 5 to it.
				</p>

				<p>
					Finally, we can write functions that take multiple parameters of
					different kinds.  For example, we can modify the <i>printGreeting</i>
					function so that it takes both a string name and an integer age, and
					prints out a message about that person's age:

					<p class="code">
						&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;<top>#include</top> <header-file> &lt;iostream&gt;</header-file>&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;<top>#include</top><header-file> &lt;string&gt;</header-file>&emsp; <br>&emsp; <br>

						&emsp;<top>using namespace</top> std;&emsp; <br>&emsp; <br>

						&emsp;<var>void</var> <function-create>printGreeting</function-create>(string name, <var>int</var> age){&emsp; <br>
						    &emsp;&emsp;cout 
						    	&lt;&lt;<string>"Hello " 
						    	&lt;&lt;name
						    	&lt;&lt;"!\n"</string>;&emsp; <br>
						    &emsp;&emsp;cout
						    	&lt;&lt;<string>"You are "
						    	&lt;&lt;age
						    	&lt;&lt;" year old.\n"</string>;&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;}&emsp; <br>&emsp; <br>


						&emsp;<var>int</var> <function-create>main()</function-create>{&emsp; <br>
						    &emsp;&emsp;<function-use>printGreeting</function-use>(<string>"Ronald McDonald"</string>, <num>49</num>);&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;}&emsp; <br>
						&emsp; <br>
					</p>
					<br>

					We just have to remember to send the function all parameters it
					expects as arguments when we call it.  Although we can have different
					nums and types of parameters, a function can only return one thing,
					so think carefully about what exactly you want to get back from a
					function before you write it.
				</p>
				
				<h3>Challenge 2:</h3> 
				<p>
					Modify the <i>printGreeting</i> function to also
					take a string <i>birthdayMonth</i> parameter, and print out a message
					that tells them how old they will be the next time it is that month.
					For the Ronald McDonald example, the output might be, "You will be 50
					next January".
				</p>
