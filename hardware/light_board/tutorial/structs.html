					Sometimes we want to group different kinds of data together.  For
					example, let's think about a bank account.  What kind of information
					does your bank account store about you?  Most importantly, it stores
					your bank account num (an integer) and your account balance (a
					float).  It also stores your name and address (both strings).  Often
					in programming, we want to group related data like this together in a
					single construct, and we can do that with structs.
				</p>

				<p>
					The first thing to think about when making a structure, shortened
					to <i>struct</i> in C++, is what its kind, or tag, will be.  For the
					bank account example above, a good tag might be <i>bankAccount</i>.
					We can define a <i>bankAccount</i> struct like this:

					<p class="code">
						&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;<var>typedef struct</var> _bankAccount{&emsp; <br>
						    &emsp;&emsp;int accountnum;&emsp; <br>
						    &emsp;&emsp;float accountBalance;&emsp; <br>
						    &emsp;&emsp;string name;&emsp; <br>
						    &emsp;&emsp;string address;&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;} <function-create>bankAccount</function-create>;&emsp; <br>
						&emsp; <br>
					</p>
				</p>

				<p>
					We tell the computer that we are declaring (creating) a struct by saying:

					<p class="code">
						&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;<var>typedef struct</var> _tag {&emsp; <br>
							&emsp;&emsp;<comment>//your code here</comment>&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;} <function-create>tag;&emsp; <br>
						&emsp; <br>
					</p>
				</p>

				<p>
					<i>tag</i> is the kind of struct you are making.  (The __tag is a
					placeholder for the var name, which is made unnecessary by the
					typedef.  We won't worry about that here.)  Inside the curly braces,
					we define the fields of the struct by saying what kind they are and
					what their names are.  This part of the struct is kind of like a
					database.  In our <i>bankAccount</i> struct, we have four fields:
					accountnum, accountBalance, name, and address.  We also tell the
					computer the type of each field by saying something like "int
				 	accountnum;" so that the computer knows that the accountnum
					field is an integer.  We close the curly braces and put a semicolon
					at the end.  The struct declaration goes before the int main() part
					of the program, as the next example shows.
				</p>

				<p>
					Each time we go to use a struct, we need to give it a unique name.
					Think about bank accounts again.  Each bank account is different, and
					my bank account and your bank account hold different information and
					have different, unique names.  We'll do the same thing here by giving
					each <i>instance</i> of our struct a unique var name.  So let's
					make some accounts like this:

					<p class="code">
						&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;<top>#include</top> <header-file> &lt;iostream&gt;</header-file>&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;<top>using namespace</top> std;&emsp; <br>&emsp; <br>

						&emsp;<var>typedef struct</var> _bankAccount{&emsp; <br>
						    &emsp;&emsp;int accountnum;&emsp; <br>
						    &emsp;&emsp;float accountBalance;&emsp; <br>
						    &emsp;&emsp;string name;&emsp; <br>
						    &emsp;&emsp;string address;&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;} <function-create>bankAccount</function-create>;&emsp; <br>&emsp; <br>

						&emsp;<var>int</var> <function-create>main</function-create>(){&emsp; <br>
						    &emsp;&emsp;bankAccount alisonBankAccount; <comment>//make a bankAccount for Alison</comment>&emsp; <br>
						    &emsp;&emsp;alisonBankAccount.accountnum = <num>14538</num>;  <comment>//assign the account a num</comment>&emsp; <br>
						    &emsp;&emsp;alisonBankAccount.accountBalance = <num>1000000.01</num>;  <comment>//give Alison some money</comment>&emsp; <br>
						    &emsp;&emsp;alisonBankAccount.name = <string>"Alison Norman"</string>;  <comment>//assign name and address</comment>&emsp; <br>
						    &emsp;&emsp;alisonBankAccount.address = <string>"1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW Washington, DC 20500"</string>;&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;}&emsp; <br>
						&emsp; <br>
					</p>
				</p>

				<p>
					We use dot notation to access the fields of a struct.  To get the
					field of a struct, we write the var name of an instance of the
					struct (alisonBankAccount), a period, and then the name of a field in
					that struct (accountnum).  We have to assign values to the fields
					in the struct because when we initially define the struct, the
					computer only knows the type of value to expect, but not the actual
					values.  That way, we can have multiple different bankAccounts, all
					with different balances and information.  For example, let's codetend
					that in addition to Alison's bank account, we made an account for Bob
					Bobson.  Here's the same code as above, but now we've added a second
					instance of the bankAccount struct:
				</p>

				<p>
					<p class="code">
						&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;&emsp;<comment>//make two different bank accounts</comment>&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;&emsp;bankAccount alisonBankAccount;&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;&emsp;bankAccount bobBankAccount;&emsp; <br>&emsp; <br>

						&emsp;&emsp;<comment>//assign two different account nums</comment>&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;&emsp;alisonBankAccount.accountnum = 14538;  <comment>//assign the account a num</comment>&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;&emsp;bobBankAccount.accountnum = <num>54324</num>;&emsp; <br>&emsp; <br>

						&emsp;&emsp;<comment>//assign different account balances</comment>&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;&emsp;alisonBankAccount.accountBalance = <num>1000000.01</num>;  &emsp; <br>
						&emsp;&emsp;bobBankAccount.accountBalance = <num>-122.52</num>;&emsp; <br>&emsp; <br>

						&emsp;&emsp;<comment>//give Bob some money to get out of debt</comment>&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;&emsp;<comment>//i.e. add 300.95 to the current value of accountBalance</comment>&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;&emsp;bobBankAccount.accountBalance += <num>300.95; </num>&emsp; <br>&emsp; <br>

						&emsp;&emsp;cout 
							&lt;&lt; <string>"Bob has $"</string> 
							&lt;&lt; bobBankAccount.accountBalance 
							&lt;&lt; <string>".  Yay Bob!\n"</string>;&emsp; <br>
						&emsp; <br>
					</p>
				</p>

				<p>
					We can give Alison and Bob's <i>bankAccount</i> structs completely
					different information, and we can also modify the values that the
					fields hold.  Notice how we gave Bob some timely money to get him out
					of debt with the line "bobBankAccount.accountBalance += 300.95;".  The
					"+=" operator means that you increase the value of the var to the
					left of the "+=" by the value on the right side of the "+=" and save
					it as the same var.  In other words, the following two lines are
					equivalent:
				</p>

				<p>
					<p class="code">
						&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;bobBankAccount.accountBalance += <num>300.95</num>;&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;bobBankAccount.accountBalance = bobBankAccount.accountBalance + <num>300.95</num>;&emsp; <br>
						&emsp; <br>
					</p>
				</p>

				<h3>Challenge 1:</h3> 
				
				<p>
					Add another bank account to the example above.  Deposit $500 dollars
					into Alison's account, then withdraw $400 from Bob's account and place
					it in the account you created.  Then print out the balances from all
					three accounts.
				</p>

				<h3>Challenge 2:</h3> 
				
				<p>
					Create a struct for super heroes.  The fields in the struct will
					include the superhero's name, his arch-nemesis, his weakness, and his
					sidekick (these are all strings).  Add some extra fields of your own.
					Then make some instances of the superhero struct using your favorite
					super hero's for inspiration.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Congratulations, you understand structs!  Now, let's move on
					to <a href="loops.html">loops</a>.
