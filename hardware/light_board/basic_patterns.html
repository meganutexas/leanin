					<h1>Basic Patterns</h1>
				</center>
				<hr>
				<br>
				
				<p>
					An interesting thing to do with these lights is to make them behave in a
					pattern.  In this section, you'll learn how to make the lights perform some
					basic patterns, and then you are free to create your own pattern.  Not only is
					creating your own pattern entertaining and challenging, but "Unique Patterns" is
					one of our showcase categories.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<h3>Challenge 4 - Part 1:</h3>
					<h4>Blink Alternating Lights</h4>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					A basic pattern is to blink every other light. Using what you've
					learned about loops, if-statements, and the modulus operator, add code
					to <tt>blink_alternating_lights()</tt> to blink every other light.
					Test it in the usual manner.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<h3>Challenge 4 - Part 2:</h3>
					<h4>Fading the Lights</h4>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					So far, you have learned how to blinks lights and change their color.  Another
					neat feature of these lights is their ability to fade.  To fade all the lights
					from off to on (or vice versa), you slowly adjust the brightness.  Take a look
					at the given function <tt>fade_brightness()</tt>.  This code for this function
					is <i>almost</i> complete, but not quite.  Uncomment the given code, and then
					modify it so that the lights fade from off to on.  Test in the usual manner.
					(Recall that you can fade individual lights by changing their color value.)
				</p>

				<p>
					<em>
						Note that <tt>setBrightness()</tt> will scale all colors to a max value,
						which will prevent the colors from appearing faded.  Your lights are currently
						set to a default value of 64 in <tt>loop()</tt>, so that the FastLED colors will
						appear more vibrant.  You may change this as you wish for your project.
					</em>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Now that you can fade the lights, try:
					<ul>
						<li> changing the color of the bulbs, so that they fade in a color of
						your choosing
						</li>
						<li> making the bulbs fade more quickly (There are TWO ways to do
						this.  What are they?)
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<p>
					<h3>Challenge 4 - Part 3:</h3>
					<h4>Chasing Lights</h4>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					One of the most recognizable patterns is that of chasing lights.  In
					this pattern, lights light up one after another in order so that it
					appears the light is moving down the strand.  You can see a sample of
					this
					in <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/O5JRPFvrdNE">this
					youtube video</a>, which shows a chase followed by a strobe.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					For this task, implement a chase pattern inside the provided
					function <tt>chase()</tt>.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<h3>Challenge 4 - Part 4:</h3>
					<h4>Chasing Lights using <tt>leds_scroll()</tt></h4>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Above you completed the chase pattern in the typical way, but this
					framework actually has special support for patterns such as chase.
					The <tt>leds</tt> data structure has not only an element for each
					light but also has an element for an extra light at the end of the
					string (spot 25).  Additionally, it provides a
					function, <tt>leds_scroll()</tt> that will automatically scroll the
					pattern for you---by shifting the characteristics of bulb x to bulb x-1.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					To use these features, set your desired characteristics to the
					fictional bulb <tt>leds[NUM_LEDS]</tt> and then
					call <tt>leds_scroll()</tt>.  You'll see that characteristic
					propagate down the lights.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Once you have played with <tt>leds_scroll()</tt> some, implement a
					chase with alternating colors in the given stub
					function <tt>chase_two_colors_with_scroll()</tt>.  This task is harder
					than the ones you have had previously, so be certain to carefully
					consider what you need to do <i>before</i> you begin coding.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<h3>Challenge 5:</h3>
					<h4>Create a Pattern of Your Choosing</h4>
				</p>
				
				<p>
				Congratulations!  You have completed all the given tasks related to
					controlling the lights and reached Competition Category One. Now you
					should create a pattern of your own design.  Some basic patterns that
					you could implement and then extend are showcased
					<a target="_blank" href="http://blog.blinkenlight.net/experiments/basic-effects/other-scanners/">at
					this website</a>, though they are not implemented in the WS2811 lights.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					To implement your pattern, you may use the project files already found in the
					sketch or add new functions to the <tt>tests/tests.h</tt> files.  Whichever you
					choose, be certain to call the appropriate functions from the <tt>loop()</tt>
					function in <tt>project_framework</tt>.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					After creating a pattern of your own design, you may choose to move on to
					either <a href="dancing_lights.html">dancing lights</a>
					or <a href="displaying_message.html">displaying a message</a>, which are also
					showcase categories, or you may show off your pattern in the patterns category.
					Whichever you choose, be sure to follow
					the <a href="rules.html">showcase rules</a>!
				</p>
				
				<p> 
					Towards the end of the week, you may want to eliminate the
					startup test pattern performed by the software.  If you need our help to do so,
					just ask!  We're always happy to help.
