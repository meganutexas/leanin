				<question>
					What is Lean in?
				</question>
				<br><br>
				<answer>
					&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Lean In Circles are small groups who meet regularly to learn and grow together,<br> 
					&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;and they're changing lives. People are asking for more, stepping outside their <br>
					&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;comfort zones, and leaning in.

				<question>
					Why should I join a circle?
				</question>

					&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Many people in groups form very tight friendships.
				</answer>

				<br><br>

				<question>
					What is a circle moderator?
				</question>
				<br><br>
				<answer>
					&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Circle moderators are like leaders of the group, without being over controlling. A moderator might <br>
					&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;be the one who sets up the cirlces' Facebook group or plans the when and where of meetings. For more <br>
					&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;formal meetings a moderator might put together a slide deck of they want to talk about. 
					<br><br>
					&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Example slide decks can be found in the "Meetings" tab.
				</answer>
				<br><br>

				<question>
					Who decides who is the moderator?
				</question>
				<br><br>
				<answer>
					&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The circle members can vote or someone can take the initiative and take charge. Moderators won't be <br>
					&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;assigned by the leadership unless absolutely necessary. Cirlces are designed to opperate pretty <br>
					&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;much autonomously. 
					<br><br>
					&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;There is a place on the <a target="_black" href="http://tinyurl.com/utcsleanin">sign up form</a> to <br>
					&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;indicate if you would like to be a moderator or not.
				</answer>
				<br><br>

				<question>
					What kind of activities do y'all do?
				</question>
				<br><br>
				<answer>
					&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;That is circle dependent. Some circles meet for meals or host fun events like sleep overs.<br>
					&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Check out the photo gallery for some pictures from previous meetings. You can do whatever helps <br>
					&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;you build your community most effectively!
				</answer>
				<br><br>

				<question>
					Can anyone join?
				</question>
				<br><br>
				<answer>

					&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;if you would like to be in a single gender or co-ed circle.
				</answer>
				<br><br>

				<question>
					How often do circles meet?
				</question>
				<br><br>
				<answer>
					&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;That is really up to your circle. You can meet as often as you would like! There isn't a lot of formal <br>
					&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;oversight of the cirlces. We just hope you are actually meeting and enjoying the community!<br>
					<br><br>

					&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;often you are able to meet.
				</answer>
				<br><br>

				<question>
					Are there events with all the circles, or do you only interact with your own circle?
				</question>
				<br><br>
				<answer>
					&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;There will occasionally be chapter (all the circles) events. We will keep the calendar on this site up to <br>
					&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;date and put events up on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1709103379304754/">Facebook Page</a>.
