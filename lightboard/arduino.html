					<h1>Getting Started with Arduino</h1>
				</center>
				<hr>
				<br>
				<p>
					As mentioned before, Project Illuminate is using
					the <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardUno">Arduino Uno</a> to
					control <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Digital-Changing-Christmas-Decorative-Wedding/dp/B00OH05D3I/">25
					color-changing LED lights</a>. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Let's begin by understanding the Arduino board and its programming
					environment.  Your group should do this part together, so please wait
					until everyone has finished the C++ tutorial.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Your board, an Arduino Uno, should look like this:
				</p>
				<br>
				
				<img src="images/arduino_uno.jpg" align="center" width="300">
				
				<p>
					First, use the provided USB cable to connect the board to the computer
					in the lab.  You want to connect it to the computer UNDER the desktop
					(not the one ON the desktop), as that is the computer running Linux.
					The computer both communicates with the Arduino and provides power to
					the Arduino through this cable.  The large end connects to either of
					the USB slots on the front of the computer, and the small end connects
					to the board here:<br>
					<img src="images/arduino_usb.jpg" align="center" width="300"><br>
					When it is connected correctly, a green LED should turn on.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The Arduino board comes with its own programming environment.  The Arduino
					programming environment is an IDE, or <i>Integrated Development Environment</i>,
					which is a program that is designed to aid in the development of other programs.
					An IDE will usually include a means of entering (typing in) and modifying
					programs, called an <i>editor</i>, and a means of translating the program to
					computer format called a <i>compiler</i>.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Now, let's open the programming environment.  First, log in to the computer
					using the username and password of one of your group members.  Once logged in,
					open a terminal (using the icon at the bottom of the screen, just as you did for
					the C++ tutorial) and type <tt>arduino &</tt>.  (The <tt>&</tt> tells the
					computer to allow you to continue to use that terminal while the IDE is
					running.)

					A window should open that looks similar to this one:<br>
					<img src="images/arduino_env_start.png" align="center" width="400"><br> 

					This window is a sketchbook, and the sketchbook is where your Arduino
					programming will begin.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Before you can use your board, you'll need to tell the computer where
					it is connected.  Do this by going to <tt>Tools->Port</tt> and selecting
					the /dev/ttyACM0 port. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<h3>Challenge 1:</h3>
					<h4>Blink Running on the Arduino</h4>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Now we'll practice using the board by executing one of the provided
					examples. From the <tt>File</tt> menu,
					select <tt>Examples->01.Basics->Blink</tt>.  This will open a new
					sketchbook, Blink.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The Blink sketchbook consists of a single file, so there is only one
					tab at the top (labeled <tt>Blink</tt>).  You'll notice that the file
					has two functions: <tt>setup()</tt> and <tt>loop()</tt>.  These
					functions exist in every Arduino program.  Arduino will
					execute <tt>setup()</tt> to initialize the device and then it will
					continuously execute the code in <tt>loop()</tt> until it is
					disconnected.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					To run Blink, click on the right arrow in the tool bar. This arrow
					tells the environment to compile the program and upload it to the
					Arduino board.<br>
					<img src="images/arduino_toolbar.png" align="center" width="400"><br> 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					After the file has successfully compiled and is being uploaded, the
					transmit and receive LEDs on your board should blink.  These LEDs
					indicate that the board is receiving and transmitting data.  They are
					located here:<br>
					<img src="images/arduino_txrx.jpg" align="center" width="400"><br> 
					Once the program is uploaded, this LED should begin to blink orange:<br>
					<img src="images/arduino_led.jpg" align="center" width="400"><br> 
				</p>

				<p>
					Congratulations!  You have successfully begun using the Arduino board.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Next, we'll learn to <a href="start_lights_hardware.html">connect the
					lights</a>.
