				<h1>Connecting the Lights</h1>
				</center>
				<hr>
				<br>
				<p>
					Now that you have learned to connect your Arduino board and you have
					an example program running, let's begin working with the lights.
				</p>
				
				<h3>Hardware</h3>
				
				<p>
					 We're going to begin with the <i>hardware</i>, which is any physical
					component of the system.  (Can you touch it?  It is hardware!)  In
					this project, your main pieces of hardware are the lights, Arduino
					board, and computer, but there are smaller pieces, too, such as the
					USB cable and wires.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					First, let's take a look at your lights.  Your strand of lights consists of 25
					LED lights.  These lights are <i>individually addressable</i>, which means that
					you can control the color and brightness of each light individually. <!-- the
					color of each individual light can be--> The color and brightness are set by
					program commands, and a sequence of program commands can make the lights display
					a pattern, a message, or whatever the programmer chooses.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Looking at the lights again, you'll notice that there are three colors of wire
					running between the lights.  Each of these wires is serving a purpose: the data
					wire (green or blue) carries data (or the programmer's instructions) to the lights, 
					the red wire carries power, and the white wire carries ground.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					  We've modified the lights for the projects, and the data wire has been
					extended using a blue wire, the power wire has been extended with red
					wire, and the ground wire has been extended with black wire.  The
					red wire and one of the black are already connected to a power cable connector
					plug&mdash;that is how your lights will be connected to the power adaptor.
				</p>
				
				<h3>Challenge 2:</h3>
				<h4>Lights Connected Correctly</h4>
				
				<p>
					Next, let's take another look at the Arduino board.  As you look at
					it, notice the numbered black components:<br>
					<img src="images/arduino_pins.jpg" align="center" width="400"><br> 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Each of the holes is a <i>pin</i>.  Pins are where we will connect the Arduino
					board to external components.  Find the pin labeled <tt>7</tt>, put the blue
					wire in this pin (the other end is already connected to the data wire).  We will
					be using pin 7 to send our instructions from the board to the lights.<br>
					<img src="images/arduino_pin7.jpg" align="center" width="400"><br>
				</p>
					
				<p>
					  Connect the free end of a black ground wire to the pin labeled <tt>GND</tt>
					(for ground, and indicated below).  The other end of this piece of black wire
					should be connected to the lights--the other black ground wire should already be
					connected to the lights and the power connector.<br>
					<img src="images/arduino_grnd.jpg" align="center" width="400"><br> 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Now plug in the lights.  To do this, plug the lights into the power adaptor in
					your box, and then plug the power adaptor into one of the plugs behind the
					monitor on your desk.  If you have trouble accessing the plug, try using the
					power strip in your box and then plugging the power adaptor into it.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					When the lights and Arduino board are fully connected, they should look
					like this:<br>
					<img src="images/fully_connected.jpg" align="center" width="800"><br> 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Next, we'll learn to <a href="controlling_lights.html">control the
