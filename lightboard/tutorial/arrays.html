				<h1 align="center">Arrays</h1>
				<hr>
				
				<p>
					Sometimes we want to store lists of data together in one place.  For
					example, it might be handy to have a list of all your grades from
					science class.  You could go back later and average all the grades in
					the list together to find out your final grade in science.  In C++,
					lists are called <i>arrays</i>, and they have some special properties.
				</p>

				<p>
					You can think of an array like a motel.  Let's begin by imagining a
					single-story motel complex.  The rooms are laid out in a row right
					next to each other.  If you stand in front of room 7, you know that
					room 8 will be right next door, and room 9 will be after room 8.
					Arrays work in the same way.  We can put values inside each of the
					"rooms" in the array, and since they are numed logically, we can
					quickly find any "room" we need.
				</p>

				<p>
					When you build a motel, you have to decide ahead of time how many
					rooms you want there to be, and you can't change your mind after the
					motel is built (without paying a lot of construction costs).  In a C++
					array, at the beginning of the function you declare the type, name,
					and size of your array.  Going back to the science grade example, we
					would declare a science grade array like this:

					<br>
					<p class="code">
						&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;<var>float</var> gradeArray[<num>5</num>];&emsp; <br>
						&emsp; <br>
					</p>
					<br>

					The brackets with the num mean that we are constructing an array
					that is five units in length named <i>gradeArray</i>.  We declare it
					as a float because we plan on storing floating point nums in each
					of the "rooms" in the array.  We can substitute the num 5 with any
					length of array we want, but once we declare our array to be a certain
					size, we can't change it.
				</p>

				<p>
					Now that we've declared an array, we need to put things inside it.
					Inside our main function, we'll enter five grades into the array.
					When you put something into an array, you have to tell it where it
					should go, just like in a motel, you don't get to randomly choose a
					room.  We talk about a specific location in an array by writing the
					name of the array and then putting the location num in brackets,
					like this: <tt>gradeArray[0]</tt> .  As with all counting in computer
					science, we have to begin at 0, so the first "room" in the array motel
					is room 0, then room 1, etc.  In <i>gradeArray</i>, there are five
					locations, which are numed 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.  Let's put some
					values into them in the following code:

					<p class="code">
						&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;gradeArray[<num>0</num>] = <num>98.3</num>;&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;gradeArray[<num>1</num>] = <num>91.1</num>;&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;gradeArray[<num>2</num>] = <num>89.8</num>;&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;gradeArray[<num>3</num>] = <num>0.5</num>;&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;gradeArray[<num>4</num>] = <num>95.0</num>;&emsp; <br>
						&emsp; <br>
					</p>
				</p>

				<p>
					Now that we have our grades in an array, we want to average them all
					together to calculate our final grade.  To do this, we need to visit
					each location in the array (imagine going from door to door in a
					motel) and sum up the values in each position, and then divide them by
					the num of values we added.  In order to do this systematically, we
					can use a for-loop.  We will loop through each element, or location,
					in the array and add its value to a var called <i>gradeSum</i>
					that we initialize ahead of time.  After we finish the loop, we will
					divide <i>gradeSum</i> by 5 to get the average.  Here's the code for
					this program:
				</p>

				<p class="code">
					<br>
					&emsp;<top>#include</top> <header-file>&lt;iostream&gt;</header-file>&emsp; <br>
					&emsp;<top>using namespace</top> std;&emsp; <br>&emsp; <br>

					&emsp;<var>int</var> <function-create>main</function-create>(){&emsp; <br>
					    &emsp;&emsp;<comment>//declare the array and the other vars</comment>&emsp; <br>
					    &emsp;&emsp;<var>float</var> gradeArray[<num>5</num>];     &emsp; <br>
					    &emsp;&emsp;<var>float</var> gradeSum, gradeAverage;&emsp; <br>
					    &emsp;&emsp;<var>int</var> i;&emsp; <br>&emsp; <br>

					    &emsp;&emsp;<comment>//put some grades into the array</comment>&emsp; <br>
					    &emsp;&emsp;gradeArray[<num>0</num>] = <num>98.3</num>;&emsp; <br>
					    &emsp;&emsp;gradeArray[<num>1</num>] = <num>91.1</num>;&emsp; <br>
					    &emsp;&emsp;gradeArray[<num>2</num>] = <num>89.8</num>;&emsp; <br>
					    &emsp;&emsp;gradeArray[<num>3</num>] = <num>90.5</num>;&emsp; <br>
					    &emsp;&emsp;gradeArray[<num>4</num>] = <num>5.0</num>;&emsp; <br>&emsp; <br>

					    &emsp;&emsp;<comment>//initialize the gradeSum var to be 0</comment>&emsp; <br>
					    &emsp;&emsp;gradeSum = <num>0</num>;&emsp; <br>&emsp; <br>

					    &emsp;&emsp;<comment>//loop through each location in gradeArray (there are 5)</comment>&emsp; <br>
					    &emsp;&emsp;<for>for</for> (i = <num>0</num>; i &gt; <num>5</num>; i++){&emsp; <br>
					        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<comment>//add the value of the thing stored at location </comment>&emsp; <br>
					        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<comment>//i in gradeArray to gradeSum</comment>&emsp; <br>
					        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;gradeSum += gradeArray[i];&emsp; <br>
					    &emsp;&emsp;}&emsp; <br>&emsp; <br>
					          
					    &emsp;&emsp;<comment>to finish the average, divide gradeSum by 5</comment>&emsp; <br>
					    &emsp;&emsp;gradeAverage = gradeSum/<num>5</num>;&emsp; <br>&emsp; <br>
					          
					    &emsp;&emsp;<comment>//print out the average</comment>&emsp; <br>
					    &emsp;&emsp;cout 
					    	&lt;&lt; <string>"Your science class average is "</string> 
					    	&lt;&lt; gradeAverage 
					    	&lt;&lt; <string>".\n"</string>;&emsp; <br>
					&emsp;}&emsp; <br>
					&emsp; <br>
				</p>

				<h3>Challenge 1:</h3> 
				
				<p>
					Can you change the program above so that it takes 7
					grades instead of 5 to calculate the average?
				</p>

				<h3>Challenge 2:</h3> 
				
				<p>
					Can you write a program that asks a user to enter 10 nums, puts
					those nums in an array, and then prints out the nums in the
					array <i>backwards</i>?  Hint: use a loop that counts backwards.
				</p>

				<p>
					Good job!  You are almost finished.  For your last lesson, you'll
					learn how to <a href="decisions.html">make decisions</a>.
