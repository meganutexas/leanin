	            <h2>Getting Ready to Code</h2>

	            <p>
	                Before you can even start writing your first program, you'll
	                have to complete a num of small tasks. The first one is 
	                logging in.
	            </p>

	            <h3><b>Logging In</b></h3>

	            <p>
	                The computers in this lab can boot into Windows or Linux. 
	                We will be using Linux. If the monitor in front of you 
	                displays a Windows login screen, click the silver button 
	                velcroed to the base of the monitor stand, and click the 
	                mouse a few times. A different login screen should appear.
	            </p>

	            <p>
	                Welcome to Linux! Enter the user name given to you, and hit 
	                Enter. Insert the password assigned to you, hit Enter one 
	                more time, and you should be taken to a desktop screen.
	            </p>
				<p>
				  If a dialog box appears asking you about what configuration to
				  use, select the option with <tt>Default</tt>.
				</p>

	            <h3><b>Changing Your Password</b></h3>

	            <p>

	                We know. Randomly generated passwords are a pain. You are 
	                allowed to change yours, and we get to teach you something 
	                about Linux at the same time! How great is that? Just follow
	                these steps:

	                <ul>
	                    <li>
	                        See those icons along the bottom of your screen? 
	                        The one that's just a black box with <kbd>$_</kbd> 
	                        in it will tell you it's a "Terminal Emulator"
	                        if you hover over it. Click it to bring up the
	                        fabled command line. More on this later.
	                    </li>
	                    <li>
	                        Type <kbd>passwd</kbd> into the command line and 
	                        hit Enter.
	                    </li>
	                    <li>
	                        Follow the directions that appear to create a new, 
	                        secure password. Don't worry if no characters show up 
	                        as you type. It is accepting your input.
	                    </li>
	                </ul>

	            </p>

	            <h3><b>Linux Commands</b></h3>

	            <p>
	                An important part of using Linux is becoming familiar with 
	                the command line. The following exercise will get you started 
	                with a few commands you'll find useful in the coming week.
	                
	                <ol>
	                    <li>
	                        <kbd>ls</kbd> is the command to list the contents of
	                        the current directory. When you first open the terminal
	                        and have a command prompt, you will be in your home 
	                        directory. The home directory is denoted by a <em>~</em>.
	                        Try typing <kbd>ls</kbd> into the command line now
	                        and hitting Enter to see what the contents of your
	                        home directory are.
	                    </li>
	                    <li>
	                        <kbd>cd</kbd> is the command to change directories.
	                        Choose one of the directories you saw listed when you 
	                        entered the <kbd>ls</kbd> command and type
	                        <kbd>cd &gt;chosen_directory&gt;</kbd> into the 
	                        command line (without angle brackets). Hit Enter.<br />
	                        <i>(Note that the command line has the idea of tab-complete.
	                        If you start typing the name of a unique file, directory, or
	                        command and hit tab, it will finish the name for you. If 
	                        there is more than one match, all possible options are 
	                        displayed.)</i>
	                    </li>
	                    <li>
	                        When you're using a terminal to navigate the filesystem, 
	                        you may want to go back up a directory level to the 
	                        <em>parent directory</em>.
	                        Just as your home directory has the <em>~</em> alias,
	                        the parent directory of the directory you are currently 
	                        in has the alias <em>..</em> (yes, that is a dot dot).
	                        Type <kbd>cd ..</kbd> into the command line and hit
	                        <kbd>Enter</kbd> to return to the parent directory.
	                    </li>
	                    <li>
	                        <kbd>pwd</kbd> will tell you what directory you
	                        are currently in. If you started this little exercise in 
	                        your home directory, typing <kbd>pwd</kbd> at the command
	                        line and hitting <kbd>Enter</kbd> will tell you 
	                        that you ended in your home directory, though not with
	                        a simple tilde; <kbd>pwd</kbd> gives 
	                        you the full, absolute path. Likely, your terminal has
	                        already been configured to display this information 
	                        at the start of its command prompt, but if not, 
	                        <kbd>pwd</kbd> is a good way to keep from getting lost.
	                        Also remember that at any point, you may enter the command
	                        <kbd>cd ~</kbd> to return to the home directory.
	                    </li>
	                </ol>
	                
	                The above is essentially a command-based version of what
	                you're used to doing by double clicking on folders. The command
	                line is capable of a great deal more -- in fact, you will 
	                be using it to compile your tutorial program! But more on that 
	                later. First, you'll need to write some code.
	            </p>

	            <h3><b>Text Editor</b></h3>

	            <p>
	                In this lab, we'll be using a text editor called <b>gedit</b>
	                to write our tutorial program in C++. We'll use a different 
	                environment for Project Illuminate. To open gedit, open up a
	                terminal window, type in <kbd>gedit &amp;</kbd> and hit
	                <kbd>Enter</kbd>. The <kbd>&amp;</kbd> tells the computer to
	                allow you to continue to use that terminal while the editor
	                is running.
	            </p>

	            <p>
	                What pops up is a basic text editor, but between it and the 
	                command line, you will be able to write and execute your 
	                tutorial programs.
	            </p>

	            <h3><b>Logging Out</b></h3>

	            <p>
	                Before you leave the lab, make sure you save all your work and
	                log out of the computer, so that it's free for the next person to use it.
	                Open up the account menu in the top right-hand corner of your screen,
	                and click to log out.
	            </p>

	            <p>
	                Also very important with these computers is that they are not rebooted.
	                If you are experiencing technical difficulties, resist the urge to try
	                turning the machine off and on again, and instead notify your PA, Clare,
	                or Alison.
	            </p>
