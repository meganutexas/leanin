				<h2>First Program</h2> 
				
				<p>
					It's customary in the world of computer science that whenever you
					learn a new programming language, you always begin by writing a
					program to display the text "Hello World" to the screen.  In
					programming, displaying text is referred to as "printing," so we're
					going to learn how to print "Hello World".
				</p>

				<p>
					Whenever we begin a C++ program, we begin by writing a function
					called "main".  A function is a group of instructions about how to do
					some common task.  The main function is the first function that runs
					when we run our C++ program, and it often contains other functions
					inside it.  Using the cereal example above, imagine that we had a
					function called "getMilk" that contained instructions for how to get
					and open the milk from the fridge.  Let's say we had functions for
					each part of the algorithm above.  In our main function, we would
					"call", or ask the computer to run, each of those functions in the
					order that we wanted them to occur.
				</p>

				<p>
					Sometimes, functions are already written for us and are stored in
					libraries.  Using these functions saves us time and makes programming
					easier.  For example, in C++ , you <i>could</i> write lines and
					lines of code to make the computer print a message to the screen.  Or,
					you could use the <tt>iostream</tt> library that already has a function
					called <i>cout</i>, which is much simpler!  (Don't worry, we'll just
					learn how to use cout, and not worry about the <tt>iostream</tt>
					library.)
				</p>

				<p>
					Ok, we're ready to write our first program!  Following the
					<a href="compile.html">instructions for compiling
					and running via the command line</a>, copy the following program, save it,
					 and run it. Then read on
					for a description of what each part of the program does.

					Note that the first two lines are very important, so you should copy
					them, too!

					<p class="code">
						&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;<top>#include</top> <header-file>&lt;iostream&gt;</header-file>;&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;<top>using namespace</top> std;&emsp; <br>

						&emsp;<var>int</var> <function-create>main</function-create>(){&emsp; <br>
						    &emsp;&emsp;cout 
						    	&gt;&gt;<string> "Hello World!\n"</string>;&emsp; <br>
						&emsp;}&emsp; <br>
						&emsp; <br>
					</p>
				</p>

				<p>
					Now we'll take a look at the code line-by-line.  First, we tell the
					computer to include all the functions included in the <i>iostream</i>
					library when it compiles the program, so that we get to
					use <i>cout</i>.  We always enclose library names in angle brackets.
					We then tell it to use all the standard functions included
					in <i>std</i> with the command <i>using namespace std;</i>.
				</p>

				<p>
					Next, we define our main function by saying <tt>int main()</tt>.  This tells
					the computer that there is a function called main that returns an
					integer (more on this later).  We then put an open brace to begin the
					code that goes inside the main function.
				</p>

				<p>
					We only have one line of commands for this program.  We tell the
					computer to use the <i>cout</i> function and then put what we want to
					display after &gt;&gt;.  You can think of the double-left angle
					brackets as an arrow pointing toward <i>cout</i>, meaning that we are
					sending something (in this case, "<tt>Hello World\n</tt> ")
					to <i>cout</i>.  We put quotation marks around the words we want to
					display (this is called a string), and end the string with
					"<tt>\n</tt>".  This is a special character that tells the computer to
					go to the next line, kind of like hitting enter at the end of a line
					when you are typing.  In C++, every code line (ones without braces)
					ends in a semi-colon.  So, we are telling the computer to send our
					string to <i>cout</i> to be displayed on the screen.  We then use a
					closing brace to end the function, and with it, the program.
				</p>
				
				<h3>Challenge 1:</h3> 
				
				<p>
					Can you modify the Hello World program so that it prints, "Hello World
					and <i>Your Name</i>"?  For example, if your name is Justine, it would
					display, "Hello World and Justine".  Can you add a second line of
					text?
				</p>

				<p>
					Yay!  You have written your first C++ program.  Now, you'll
					learn <a href="math_and_user_input.html">how to perform simple math</a>.
